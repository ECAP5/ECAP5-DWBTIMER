Introduction
============

Purpose
-------

This documents aims at defining the requirements for ECAP5-DWBTIMER as well as describing its architecture. Both user and product requirements will be covered.

Intended Audience and Use
-------------------------

This document targets hardware engineers who shall implement ECAP5-DWBTIMER by refering to the described architecture. It is also intended for system engineers working on the integration of ECAP5-DWBTIMER in ECAP5. Finally, this document shall be used as a technical reference by software engineers configuring ECAP5-DWBTIMER through hardware-software interfaces.

Product Scope
-------------

ECAP5-DWBTIMER is a timer peripheral accessible through a wishbone bus. This peripheral is designed to be used by ECAP5.
